# Randomly pick Joe Mama or Joe Biden in every programming language
**Note**: This is not a political movement, we all know Joe Biden > Joe Mama
## History
'Twas a dark and stormy school day (like all). A student who thought he was god at JS (he's actually only half-decent) descended into the computer teacher's classroom. As soon as he found out the 3 month course, was gonna end in him writing three lines of JS, he became furious. He emailed me (@Sid220), a basic JS file that printed into the terminal, Joe Mama or Joe Biden. Before long it became a competition and eventually evolved into what it is today, a sad GitHub repo.
